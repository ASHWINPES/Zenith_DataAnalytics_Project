Project Title: Health Insurance Marketplace

Data Description:
-  

This data was originally prepared and released by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).

The Data directory has six CSV files that contain the combined at across all years:

-BenefitsCostSharing.csv
-BusinessRules.csv
-Network.csv
-PlanAttributes.csv
-Rate.csv
-ServiceArea.csv

Additionally, there are two CSV files that facilitate joining data across years:
-Crosswalk2015.csv - joining 2014 and 2015 data
-Crosswalk2016.csv - joining 2015 and 2016 data


The actual data is too big(around 700MB) so we only uploaded the rows from top which will make the csv file less than 25MB.

Next steps:
  -we are going to sample the data as we cannot study whole population.
  -literature survey on the data.
